### Actionsheet

###### Oct, 2012

![ActionSheet Screenshot][9]

Actionsheet is similar to iOS's [UIActionSheet][2]. It is a modal sheet that can be used to prompt user for choices. 

It is added to this version as an extension: `jqt.actionsheet.js`. When loaded, it attempts to load `jqt.actionsheet.css` from the same directory. (If you use ASL, such as require.js, you might need to include the css explicitly.) 

The actionsheet uses the same markup as a jQT page and must be a direct child of `<div id="jqt"/>`.

To trigger an actionsheet, use an anchor with class, `action` (ie, `<a class="action">`) 

Tapping on any anchor on the sheet causes the sheet to dismiss. After the sheet is dismissed, the original jQT action will be triggered. 

Here is an example sniplet:

```html    
<div id="ui">
    < ... >
        <ul class="rounded">
            <li class="arrow"><a class="action" href="#actionsheet">Action</a></li>
        </ul>
    < ... >
</div>
<div id="actionsheet" class="actionsheet">
    <div class="actionchoices">
        <a href="#action_performed" class="whiteButton">Open in Safari</a>
        <a href="#action_performed" class="whiteButton">Plan B</a>
        <a href="#" class="redButton dismiss">Cancel</a>
    </div>
</div>
```

Please refers to [demos/main/index.html#ui][4] for code sample.

### Menusheet

###### Oct, 2012

![MenuSheet Screenshot][10] 

Menusheet is first made popular by facebook app on iOS. The menusheet hides beneath the main page and is revealed by a slide animation when activated.

Its usage is very similar to actionsheet. 

It is added to this version of jQT as an extension: `jqt.menusheet.js`. When loaded, it attempts to load `jqt.menusheet.css` from the same directory. (If you use ASL, such as require.js, you might need to include the css explicitly.) 

The menusheet uses the same markup as a jQT page and must be a direct child of `<div id="jqt">`. 

To trigger an actionsheet, use an anchor with class, menu (ie, `<a class="menu">`) 

Tapping on any anchor on the sheet will cause the sheet to dismiss. After the sheet is dismissed, the original jQT action will be triggered. 

Please refers to [demos/main/index.html#ui][4] for code sample. 

### Unit Tests

###### Dec 18th, 2012

We have added unit tests into this release.

They can be found under test/unit/. Each test is a *.html file and can be run by simply open it with a web browser.

The tests can also be run from a command line. Under build/, exec `grunt test`.

### Init Options: updateHash

###### Dec 18th, 2012

When options updateHash is set to true (default), page navigation will cause the url hash(#) to be updated.

```javascript
var jQT = new $.jQTouch({updateHash: false});
```                      

### Init Options: starter (Experimental)

###### Dec 23rd, 2012

Added init options, starter. By defaults, jQTouch is started upon `$(document).ready`.

For example, this option can be overridden:

- to work with dynamically loaded body. The relevant part of the dom might not be available at `$(document).ready`.

- to react upon user action

Here is some code example:

```javascript
function starter(start) {
    $(document).bind('ready', function() {
       $('https://beedesk.fwd.wf#magic_button').bind('touchstart mousedown', function() {
           start();
       });
    });
 }
 var jQT = new $.jQTouch({starter: starter});  
```

### Fixed Tap During Animation Break Navigation Bug

###### Nov 2012

Prior to this release, rapid taps on anchor before page transition ended might cause page navigation to break. The problem is fixed in this release.

### Fixed intermittent touchscroll not-scrollable problem

###### Dec 19th, 2012

For .scroll, overflow-y: scroll is used instead. Some old workaround on minHeight is removed. Tested on iPhone 4s, iPad 3, Nexus 7 and Safari
